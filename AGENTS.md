# Repository Agent Instructions

This file centralizes guidance for automated agents and LLM assistants working in this repository. Detailed, actionable instructions have been split into individual documents under the `docs/` directory. Agents must ALWAYS consult and follow those documents before making changes.

Docs index

- Clerk authentication: docs/CLERK_AUTH.md
- shadcn/ui components: docs/SHADCN_UI.md

Quick rules for agents

- Make minimal, focused changes; prefer fixing root causes.
- Run linters and tests when available before committing.
- Never commit secrets or credentials; if found, redact and report.
- Ask concise clarification questions when requirements are unclear.

Maintainers: keep these docs up to date. Split or add new topic files under `docs/` as necessary.
